Hello Everyone, 
I'm here uploading the top 5 basic sorting algorithms in DSA that are:
    1. Selection Sort
    2. Bubble Sort
    3. Insertion Sort
    4. Merge Sort
    5. Quick Sort
Along with their time and space complexities.
These codes are simplified by me in python and are very easy to understand.

I'm also pushing a module created by me "SortingalgorithmsbyKaran".
You can pull this in your local system and next time you want to use any of the above algorithms 
you can just import the module in your code.

For example, if I want to use selection sort. 

    from SortingalgorithmsbyKaran import *
    list1 = [10,20,30,2,14]
    SortingalgorithmsbyKaran.selectionsort(list1, 'DESC')
    print(list1)

The functions take the list as an argument. The second argument is "ASC" that is if you want to sort the 
list in ascending order, or it can be "DESC" if you want to sort the list in descending order.
By default, it is set to "ASC". Note the functions do not return anything they sort the actual 
passed list in place.
